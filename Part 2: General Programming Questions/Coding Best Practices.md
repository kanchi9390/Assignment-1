### ‚óè Discuss three coding best practices that you consider important for maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.

##### Maintaining a clean and efficient codebase is crucial for long-term development, collaboration, and scalability. Here are three coding best practices that contribute to a clean and efficient codebase:

#### 1.Modularity: 
##### Break your code into small functions.Each function should have well-defined interface.This makes code easy to maintain and allows for easier testing and debugging.

#### 2.Readable Code: 
##### Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names, and provide comments when necessary. Follow a consistent coding style, and consider adopting a style guide or linter to enforce coding standards across the codebase.
Example:
```
# Poor naming
def func(a, b):
    return a + b

# Improved naming
def calculate_sum(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

#### 3.Follow the DRY Principle:
##### Avoid duplicating code by organizing it in a modular and reusable way. Duplicated code not only increases the chances of introducing bugs but also makes maintenance more challenging.
